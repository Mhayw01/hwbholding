        “HWB isn’t just a wellness centre, it’s a community. It’s built from my journey, rooted in Barry, and created for anyone who needs a space to reset, reconnect, or just breathe.
        <br/><br/>
        It was a turning point, a moment that gave me clarity, a sense of purpose, and the drive to build something that could make a real difference in people’s lives. That moment came when two close friends took me to a contrast therapy session — and I realised: this is exactly what the Vale of Glamorgan needs.
        <br/><br/>
        With the support of my very good friends Helen and Ian, that vision has been brought to life.
        <br/><br/>
        What helps me, helps others.
        <br/><br/>
        Everyone deserves access to self-care, no matter their background, job, or situation. You’re welcome here, exactly as you are.”
